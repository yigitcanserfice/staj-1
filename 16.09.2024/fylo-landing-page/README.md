# Frontend Mentor - Fylo landing page with dark theme and features grid

![Design preview for the Fylo landing page with dark theme and features grid challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Here is my solution to the Fylo landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor. During the development processed, I learned more about :
* css grid and flexbox
* media queries
* responsive design
* accessibility

I also had fun with trying to make it so that on larger screens, only the header and the intro are displayed and you have to scroll to get to the rest of the content. I also added a bit of interaction with the buttons.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

### Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You can find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

You can find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Submit it on the platform so that other users will see your solution on the site. Other users will be able to give you feedback, which could help improve your code for the next project.
2. Share your repository and live URL in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
3. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor** including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
